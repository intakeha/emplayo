	<p>At Emplayo, our mission is to help everyone find the career, company, and ultimately, job, that are a perfect fit for them.</p>
 
	<p>We know first-hand how challenging the job market can be.  From choosing your career path, to deciding if you should work
	for a global multinational or a private start-up, to navigating the hiring process: life for a job-seeker can be confusing and stressful.
	There are resources that try to tell you what the &#34;top&#34; companies are, but you are a unique individual - do those companies fit you 
	and your preferences?</p>

	<p>Each of us, as founders, has faced our own challenges during the job search process, and we felt that we could improve upon 
	the status quo.  So, we put our brains together and came up with Emplayo.  Emplayo takes your detailed, personal preferences into 
	account during the job search process.  We combine your preferences with our &#39;Behind-The-Walls&#39; company data to determine the 
	best matches for you.  And best of all, we make the process interactive and fun.</p>

	<p>We hope you enjoy using Emplayo.  Above and beyond that, we sincerely hope you find the perfect job, at the perfect company!</p>
