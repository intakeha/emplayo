Convert.php is used to convert an SQL file to the format needed by ruckusing.

It required some tweaking to know how to deal with different column types (e.g. tinyint,etc)

TO RUN:
edit the file variable $string to be the name of the sql file you want to convert.  This sql file should 
be in the same folder as convert.php

Run from the command line version of php

The output can be piped into a file as such:

    php convert.php>converted_data.out
